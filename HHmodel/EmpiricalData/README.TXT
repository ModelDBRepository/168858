NeuronList.txt
  I'm not certain what this is, but it looks like a summary of the different neurons, as provided by Jennie.

PhysiologyAndMorphology.csv
  A CSV file containing all the paper-relevant data from the "Physiology & Morphology" spreadsheet that Jennie sent me back in the beginning of this process.
  * The column "distanceToPialSurface-LuebkeOriginal" is based on the contents of the file NeuronList.txt, which I think came from Jennie's lab.
  * The column "distanceToPialSurface-CoskrenFromStacks" is based on the measurements from the stacks that I did.


StacksSummary.csv
  A CSV file containing the paper-relevant data that was stored in my Google Docs spreadsheet where I kept track of the progress of the different stacks.

SomaDepthRemeasurement.csv
  These were the re-measurements done by Jim from Jennie's lab, to validate the reported voxel resolution in Doron's notes.
